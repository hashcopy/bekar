Title: Reopened IDOR Vulnerability â€” Cross-Employer Employee Data Access Despite 403 Status
Description:
It has been observed that previously reported IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities have resurfaced across multiple endpoints. Although the server responds with HTTP 403 Forbidden, a valid response payload is still returned when attempting to access data belonging to an employee of a different employer (cross-admin scenario).

This indicates that the access control enforcement is superficial (status code only) and the backend logic is still processing and returning sensitive data.

The issue appears to exist in multiple endpoints where employer administrators can access employee data across tenants/employers, violating tenant isolation.

Impact:
Exposure of employee data across employer boundaries.

Violation of multi-tenant security boundaries.

Potential data privacy and compliance violations.

Increased risk of insider misuse or unauthorized data harvesting.

Severity: High
CVSS v3.1 Vector (Example):
AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
Base Score: ~8.3 (High)

Recommendation:
Enforce strict backend authorization checks to validate resource ownership before processing and returning data.

Ensure 403 responses are accompanied by empty or sanitized response bodies.

Conduct a full audit of affected endpoints to identify and patch similar logic flaws in access control.

Implement automated tests for multi-tenant isolation to prevent regression of such issues.
